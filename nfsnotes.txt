nfs notes:
todo:
- do I want to use kickStartRT? 
-- all i have is final image....

- if I want to support textures for d3d9on12, it looks like i'll have to do uploads to those textures myself
-- the app was using managed_pool which seems to allow mapping
-- I could create all the textures as dynamic I think
-- dynamic works with unwrapping... but it seems the textures aren't swizzled correctly...
-- copy the device_imple update_texture_region (create temp texture ondemand)
- convert to list of barriers for bvhs built the current frame
- make warning disable list configurable through the .ini
- go through reshade for wrap/unwrap commands
- crash with execute command list goes away when using my own render target :-/
-- this occurs when i have the debug layer enabled... :-|
-- repro with dx9 sample and send to ms
-- this could be because of a mismatched dll d3d12.dll d3d12core.dll or sdklayers.dll
-- tried upgrading to the agility sdk but this crash still repros.
-- maybe that means I can repro in a small project
- categorize/bin vs, ps, blend states
- mapped/updated geometry should do a blas refit, not a full rebuild if possible
- the proxies are not being passed to the d3d9on12 create function
-- something isn't hooked correctly for d3d12 32-bit
-- maybe I just need to make this mode more pass through?
-- could be related to different d3d12 versions?
--- the version (maybe d3d12.dll and d3d12core.dll) might not match what reshade builds against
- find better way to get viewproj matrix (not hard coded to a specific draw)
- use amd d3d12 memory allocator
- if i don't mark buffers as dynamic, can I then unwrap them?
-- hard to do this in advance, I'd only know on map if the buffer needed to be dynamic...
- add smarter way to free blases that haven't been seen or built in a while
-- linkedlist, deque?
- decode all the texcoord stream elements
- 3rd bounces seem too dark from shadowed surfaces. maybe a bug here...
-- missing the albedo color as well....
- only do 3+ bounces if you've hit a mirror surface
