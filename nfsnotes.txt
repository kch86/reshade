nfs notes:
todo:
- get tlas building workinng
- do I want to use kickStartRT? 
-- all i have is final image....

- if I want to support textures for d3d9on12, it looks like i'll have to do uploads to those textures myself
-- the app was using managed_pool which seems to allow mapping
-- I could create all the textures as dynamic I think
-- dynamic works with unwrapping... but it seems the textures aren't swizzled correctly...
-- copy the device_imple update_texture_region (create temp texture ondemand)
- convert to list of barriers for bvhs built the current frame
- make warning disable list configurable through the .ini
