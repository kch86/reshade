nfs notes:
todo:
- do I want to use kickStartRT? 
-- all i have is final image....

- if I want to support textures for d3d9on12, it looks like i'll have to do uploads to those textures myself
-- the app was using managed_pool which seems to allow mapping
-- I could create all the textures as dynamic I think
-- dynamic works with unwrapping... but it seems the textures aren't swizzled correctly...
-- copy the device_imple update_texture_region (create temp texture ondemand)
- convert to list of barriers for bvhs built the current frame
- make warning disable list configurable through the .ini
- go through reshade for wrap/unwrap commands
- crash with execute command list goes away when using my own render target :-/
-- this occurs when i have the debug layer enabled... :-|
-- repro with dx9 sample and send to ms
- categorize/bin vs, ps, blend states
- mapped/updated geometry should do a blas update, not a full rebuild and allocation if possible
- the proxies are not being passed to the d3d9on12 create function
-- something isn't hooked correctly for d3d12 32-bit
- don't re-create shadow resources if they've already been created (e.g. updates)
- find better way to get viewproj matrix (not hard coded to a specific draw)
- use amd d3d12 memory allocator
